# Schedule Generator

This repo includes c++ code that creates schedules based on the users preferences that include:

* Desired general education requirements
* Desired classes 

Each class represents a gene and each class schedule represents a genome 

To run the code:

* download and cd into the folder containing the genetic.cpp file
* run g++ -std=c++11 -o genetic genetic.cpp
* run ./genetic
